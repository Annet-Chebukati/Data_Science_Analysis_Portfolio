# Projects

## [Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression: Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/%20Car%20Price%20Prediction%20-%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)

In this project, I utilized a linear regression model to predict car prices and further explored the methods used to interpret and evaluate the results of our model. The project involved the following steps:
- Data Assessment: The initial step involved a thorough assessment of the data to understand its structure and content.
- Building Models: I built a basic linear regression model using selected features and ran the model summary. I also constructed a full linear regression model using a comprehensive range of features available.
- Feature Engineering: I plotted a correlation matrix and reduced the number of independent variables through feature engineering. I also performed one-hot encoding on categorical variables.
- Model Training and Prediction: I split the data into train and test sets, fitted the model to the training data, and performed predictions on the test set.
- Model Refinement: I printed the summary output of the model, selected variables that were statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) and retrained the model.
- Scaling Variables: I scaled the independent variables and fitted the model with the standardized data.
- Model Evaluation: Finally, I evaluated the performance of the Linear Regression model.

## [Predicting Credit Card Approval - Classification Model: Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/Predicting%20Credit%20Card%20Approval%20-%20Classification.ipynb)

In this project, I developed an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning classification techniques. The project involved the following steps:
- Data Loading: The initial step involved loading and viewing the dataset.
- Data Preprocessing: The dataset contained a mixture of numerical and non-numerical features, values from different ranges, and several missing entries. I preprocessed the dataset to ensure the machine learning model could make good predictions.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: After the data was in good shape, I performed some exploratory data analysis to build my intuitions.
- Model Building: Finally, I built a machine learning classification model that predicts if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.

## [Google Play Store Apps and Reviews: Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/Google%20Play%20Store%20apps%20and%20reviews.ipynb)

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. The project involved the following steps:
- Data Analysis: I analyzed the Android app market, looking for insights into the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.
- Comparison: I compared over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories to understand the market dynamics.
- Insights: I looked for insights into the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

## [A Visual History Of Nobel Price Winners: Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/A%20visual%20History%20of%20Nobel%20Price%20Winners.ipynb)

In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis on the Nobel prize winners' dataset spanning from 1901 to 2016. The project involved the following steps:
- Data Analysis: I performed an exploratory data analysis on the Nobel prize winners' dataset, looking for patterns, trends, and insights.
- Insights Extraction: I extracted insights from the dataset, focusing on the distribution of prizes across different categories, countries, and over time.
- Data Visualization: I visualized the data to better understand the patterns and trends observed.

## [Analyze International Debt Statistics - SQL: Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyze%20International%20Debt%20Statistics.ipynb)

In this project, I analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. The project aimed to answer the following questions:
- Total Debt: What is the total debt owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Maximum Debt: Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what is that amount?
- Average Debt: What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

## [Analyze NYC Public School Test Results Score - SQL: Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20NYC%20Public%20School%20Test%20Result%20Scores.ipynb)

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of data on SATs across public schools in New York City. The project involved the following steps:
- Data Analysis: I performed an exploratory data analysis on the SATs dataset, looking for patterns, trends, and insights.
- Insights Extraction: I extracted insights from the dataset, focusing on the distribution of scores across different schools, districts, and over time.
- Data Visualization: I visualized the data to better understand the patterns and trends observed.
