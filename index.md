### Process and Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: I began by importing the dataset into an SQL environment, ensuring the data was clean and structured for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: I conducted an initial exploration to understand the data's characteristics and identify any patterns.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: The text data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure it was in the optimal format for modeling.
4. **Sentiment Labeling**: Each review was labeled according to sentiment derived from the text content and associated ratings.
5. **Text Vectorization**: I transformed the text data into a numerical format that machine learning models could interpret.
6. **Model Building**: A machine learning model was constructed to classify the reviews' sentiments accurately.
7. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance was rigorously assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics.
8. **Sentiment Analysis Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard was created using Streamlit to visualize and interact with the sentiment analysis results.

## **MICROSOFT EXCEL**

## [Excel - 3 Statement Financial Model](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Data_Science_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/Excel/3%20Statement%20Model.pdf)

<center><img src="Images/3StatementModel.png"/></center>

The above charts are derived from an Excel 3-statement financial model. These charts represent the Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement of a company from 2016A to 2023E.
The 3-statement financial model is a type of financial model that uses three financial statements of a company: the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. It is a highly interconnected model where changes in one statement flow through to the others, providing a comprehensive view of a company's financial health. The model helps in financial analysis, decision-making, and valuation of a company.

**Income Statement Chart:**
- **Revenue (Blue Bars):** The revenue shows an increasing trend from 2016A to 2023E, indicating the company's business growth.
- **EBITDA Margin (Orange Line):** The EBITDA margin is relatively stable with slight fluctuations. It represents the companyâ€™s operational profitability.
- **Net Income Margin (Grey Line):** This margin is decreasing over time, suggesting that net profitability is declining relative to revenue, possibly due to increased costs or expenses.

**Cash Flow Statement Chart:**
- **Operations (Blue Bars):** Positive values suggest that the companyâ€™s core business operations are generating cash inflows.
- **Investing (Orange Bars):** Negative values indicate cash outflows related to investments. There's an increase in investment activities over time.
- **Financing (Yellow Bars):** It fluctuates over the years, representing changes in debt, equity, or dividend payments.
- **Change in Cash (Line Graph):** The line graph indicates variations in the companyâ€™s cash position over time.

## [Excel - Annual Website Performance Metrics](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Data_Science_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/Excel/Website.pdf)

<center><img src="Images/Website.png"/></center>

**Building the Dashboard:**
1. **Visualization Tools:** Utilized Excel to create visual representations displaying key metrics.
2. **Dashboard Elements:**
   - **Top Section:** Contains four semi-circular gauges indicating Website Traffic, number of Page Views, Conversion Rate, and New Customers.
   - **Middle Section:** Displays a bar graph titled "# of Orders" with bars representing the number of orders each month and orange triangles indicating the target number of orders.
   - **Bottom Section:** Shows an area graph titled "Revenue" the area representing actual revenue and a line representing target revenue, and a line graph titled "EBITDA Margin" with two lines showing actual EBITDA margin and target EBITDA margin.

**Interpretation of Findings:**
1. **Website Traffic:** The gauge indicates that the website traffic is at 75%.
2. **# of Page Views:** The number of page views is at 40%.
3. **Conversion Rate:** The conversion rate is at 32%.
4. **New Customers:** The number of new customers is at 65%.
5. **# of Orders:** This graph provides a month-by-month breakdown of the number of orders placed. The blue bars represent the actual number of orders received each month, while the orange triangles indicate the target number of orders. By comparing the height of the bars with the position of the triangles, you can see how well the company is meeting its targets. For instance, if the blue bar exceeds the orange triangle in a given month, it means the company has surpassed its order target for that month.
6. **Revenue:** The area graph shows the actual revenue and the orange line target revenue. This graph shows the companyâ€™s revenue performance over time. The solid area represents the actual revenue, while the dotted line represents the target revenue. The distance between these two lines indicates the gap between the companyâ€™s actual and target revenues. If the solid area is above the dotted line, it means the companyâ€™s actual revenue has exceeded its target. Conversely, if the solid area is below the dotted line, it means the company has fallen short of its revenue target.
7. **EBITDA Margin:** EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) Margin is a measure of a companyâ€™s operating profitability as a percentage of its total revenue. The graph shows the actual EBITDA margin (solid line) and the target EBITDA margin (dotted line). If the solid line is above the dotted line, it means the companyâ€™s actual EBITDA margin is higher than its target, indicating better-than-expected profitability. If the solid line is below the dotted line, it means the companyâ€™s profitability is lower than its target.
This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for decision-making, helping to identify trends, monitor performance, and guide strategic planning for the website.
